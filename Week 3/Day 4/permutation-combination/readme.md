# Sample Lesson Plan
- [Permuation and Combination Intro](Permutations_and_Combinations.pdf) (30 minutes)
  - Two class exercises at end

1. **[Permutation and Combination presentation](Permutations_and_Combinations.pdf) (10 minutes):** Remind students of the formulas.
2. **Class Exercises (20 minutes)**: There are two class exercises. Allow the students to work in pairs to figure out the answer for 5 minutes, then have a student volunteer come up to the whiteboard and explain their answer for 5 minutes. Do this for both exercises. The solutions can be found [here](exercise_solutions.md).

## Learning Objectives
* Students should understand the differences between the formulas for permutations with repetition, permutations without repetition and combinations.
* Students should be able to apply the formulas to problems that do not directly ask for the calculations.
