## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should know the basic vocabulary of probablity, including discrete and continuous. Testable objectives include:  

* Knowing the axioms of probablity
* When do you add probabilities and when do you multiply them
* How to manipulate probablities using the axioms to get conditional probability
