# Pair Problem

### Some math to get us started
* What is the derivative of $x^{2}$?
* What is the derivative of log(x)?
* What is the derivative of $e^{x}$?
* z = f(y) & y = g(x) what is $\frac{dz}{dx}$?

### Gradient Descent for linear regression (OLS) from scratch

Today we'll be writing stochastic gradient descent for linear regression from scratch! Woo!
