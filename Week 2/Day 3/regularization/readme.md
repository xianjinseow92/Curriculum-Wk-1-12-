# Sample Lesson Plan

- (60m) [Regularization Presentation](Regularization.pptx)
- (30-45m) [Regularization Code](regularization_code.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can:

- Understand the bias-variance tradeoff and its relationship with over/underfitting
- Learn how regularization can reduce overfitting by punishing model complexity and build intuition for how it works
- Work through an applied example of regularization, reviewing key practical considerations like validation workflows
