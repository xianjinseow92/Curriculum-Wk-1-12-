# Sample Lesson Plan
- (90m) [Linear Regression Code Intro](intro-to-regression-starter.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this notebook the students should:
- Be able to visualize data
- Look for correlations and multicollinearity
- Understand how linear regression models work
- Interpret basic regression statistics like R^2
- Do basic feature engineering and selection to improve models

# Depends On
