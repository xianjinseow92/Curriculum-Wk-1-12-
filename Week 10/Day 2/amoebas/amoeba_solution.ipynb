    "* For simulation, choose the right probability function for random draws.  It's possible to make this very inefficient. If so, you might only be able to run it around 20 time periods.  A better choice could yield hundreds of time periods for a thousand amoeba lines.\n",
    "* If the number of amoeba gets too large, Python will hit memory problems and start making the counts negative.  This causes problems for random draws and might throw an error if the cumulative count dips negative.  I didn't have problems when simulating about 50 periods."
