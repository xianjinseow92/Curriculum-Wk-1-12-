In each of the folders `exercise_set_0X`, open `index.html` in the browser and complete the TODO sections in the file `functions.js`

More specifically:
* In `exercise_set_01`, open `index.html` in the browser. It is a self-documentating set of instructions on how to modify itself!
* In `exercise_set_02`, open `index.html` in the browser. The button doesn't yet "work". Implement `functions.js` TODO sections until it does work!
* `exercise_set_03` contains a detailed README with instructions on how to run the application. Open `index.html` in the browser.  You will need to implement the callback functions in `functions.js` so that the results are printed to the webpage.
