# Sample Lesson Plan

Work through the instructions in [Deploying Flask Apps on Heroku](deploy-flask-heroku.md) with your students to help them deploy our iris classification flask app on the Heroku platform. 

# Learning Objectives

Get students started with Heroku, a cloud-based app hosting platform that will enable them to show off applications and visualizations powered by their data science projects.

# Depends On

Flask Web Apps is the only hard dependency. But point out that many other tools introduced in Week 5 (Javascript, Bokeh, D3) can also be used in flask apps.
