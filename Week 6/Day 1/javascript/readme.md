# Sample Lesson Plan

* (15 minutes) [Why javascript](why_javascript.pptx) slide deck
* (35 minutes) [Exercise set 1](exercise_set_01).
  * Some instructions and useful notes in [javascript_basics](javascript_basics.md). These exercises show javascript manipulating the DOM.
* (15 minutes) [Exercise set 2](exercise_set_02). There is only one exercise here, and it shows how to use javascript and jQuery to manipulate forms, and extract values.
* (35 minutes) [Exercise set 3](exercise_set_03). This shows how to do POST requests with Flask, and how to use `$.post` from jQuery to make requests from JS, and process the results.
* (20 mins) Instructor demos the [Predictor App](predictor_app).
  * Change the template used in `predictor_app.py` to each of the 4 html files to show that one only has to change a tiny amount of the Flask app to completely change the front end.
