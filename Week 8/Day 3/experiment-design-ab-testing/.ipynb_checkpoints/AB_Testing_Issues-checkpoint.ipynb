    "### Practical issues with A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue our example. If we have a \"bank\" of customers, we could fire off 3826 emails of variation A, 3826 emails of variation B, and then if B performed better, we could email the rest of our customers variation B. If A did better, or there was no clear winner, we would fall back to the default of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we were interested in only targeting new signups, and that our site had 3000 people join a week. Then how long would we run our test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive estimate would be that we need a total of 3826 * 2 = 7652 people. We have 3000 / 7 = 428 people per day. So maybe we should run the experiment for 7652 / 428 = 17 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, provided the type of people that visit our site on Monday are the same as the people that visit on Saturday. Often, websites have different volumes of traffic depending on day of the week. Employed people have different representation during the week than after it (over- or under-representation depends on the site: EW.com has a different profile than LinkedIn)\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a weekly cycle, you are better to round up to the nearest whole week. In this case: 7652 / 3000 = 2.55, so I would run for three weeks before drawing a conclusion. If I was looking at high cost purchases, I might see monthly patterns in my sales (as most people are paid monthly). If I did see significant monthly variation, I would push to extend the experiment to run for a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also consider (at design time) splitting your customers into clusters. Just because variationA outperforms variationB over the entire population, you can find that variationB outperfoms variationA on some subset (e.g. people on the west coast, people that log on after 5 pm, et cetra). You can choose to show different variations for different clusters. If you do this, you should know that the power calculations for sample size are the number of people that need to see each variation _per cluster_, rather than overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have phrased A/B testing in terms of clicking through an email. Generally there are two types of A/B tests I have seen:\n",
    "1. Engagement: do people who see variation A use the site more than people who see variation B? We are interested in optimizing the return rate.\n",
    "2. Call-to-action: Each view of a variation asks a user to do something (e.g. open the email). We are interested in optimizing the success rate, which is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methods have all been based around \"call-to-action\" (see the email, then open it). Sometimes it is less clear cut, especially for \"Engagement\" campaigns. If you change the Duolingo Owl graphics to see if you can entice people back to learn a language more, are you going to count the number of visits that user has to the site for the next day as correlated with the campaign? The next week? The next month? Determining the answer to these questions is often a mix of looking at historical records of your users, and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use-case is looking at user-flow through a sign-up process. When do the users leave? If you show them a different process, do more of them sign up? Are you optimizing for total number of signups, or are you interested in only particular demographics. To avoid multiple testing, you should plan you experiment (including the metrics) **before** running the experiment."

    "A case that has less to do with web-development: you can also A/B test your **pricing and discount structures.** Uber and Lyft do this when experimenting with surge pricing and incentives for drivers. Here you have to be particularly careful, because the experiments can interfere with each other. A great example of this is on Lyft's blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://eng.lyft.com/experimentation-in-a-ridesharing-marketplace-b39db027a66e\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment here was to **compare a passengers that didn't get charged a surge with those that do.** In an experiment where there is only one car nearby to pickup, the person with the cheaper fare will be more likely to request a ride than the person with the more expensive fare. This is what Lyft want to measure. But the effect is compounded by \"blocking\": whoever takes the car first stops the other person from taking the same car. In a naive A/B test or simulation where you randomly assign people to the variations, the people with the discount are expected to take $3\\times$ more rides compared to those that don't. If you design the experiment differently to eliminate \"blocking\" (e.g. discount surges for everyone at randomly selected times) the actual effect is closer to a $1.33$ multiplier -- a huge difference!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should aslo communicate to the devs on your team that, where possible, the same user should see the same variation each time. If Amazon is running an A/B test with green \"buy\" buttons, they should make sure that I see a green \"buy\" button until the experiment is over. Randomly seeing different elements can make people skeptical about using a site.\n"
