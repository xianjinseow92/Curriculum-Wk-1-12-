# Sample Lesson Plan

**Gradient Boosting Notebook** (~60-90 minutes)

Optional:
**Pair problem**: students code a gradient boosting algorithm from scratch, morning before (or after) the lecture

# Learning Objectives

* Understand the basic mathematical framework behind gradient boosted trees and the model's key hyperparameters
* Understand the typical use cases for gradient boosting and some of the pros and cons
* Build familiarity with the widely used xgboost package and practice selecting/tuning hyperparameters
