# Learning Objectives

The students should take-away:
* Dask looks a lot like pandas
* It works by partitioning data into chunks and cleverly processing those
chunks
* Dask is lazy in evaluation by creating DAGs
* Dask plays well with SkLearn, Numpy, Etc
* Dask can work on cluster computing and even supports it's own cluster build
