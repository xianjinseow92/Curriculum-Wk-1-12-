# Sample Lesson Plan

1. [Curse of dimensionality deck (15 min)](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/blob/master/curriculum/project-04/curse-of-dimensionality/curse_of_dim_lecture.pdf)
2. [Curse of dimensionality notebook (15 min)](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/blob/master/curriculum/project-04/curse-of-dimensionality/Curse_of_Dimensionality.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Student's should be able to:

* Recognize situations where the Curse of Dimensionality is likely to cause problems.
* Explain how the Curse of Dimensionality works, both at a high level, and precisely with either math or code.

# Depends On





# Revision Notes

Things changed from beta:

* Added a classifiation example in the notebook to show how model accuracy degrades when we just add dimensions
* Added a PowerPoint with illustrations of fitting a classification model in 1D, 2D, and then 3D, then showing how the 3D could be over-fitting when collapsed back to 2D

# Additional Resources

* [Counterpoint from Andrew Gelman: The blessing of dimensionality](https://andrewgelman.com/2004/10/27/the_blessing_of/)
