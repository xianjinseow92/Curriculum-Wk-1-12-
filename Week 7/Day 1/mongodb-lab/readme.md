# Sample Lesson Plan
- [Mongo Shell](mongo_shell.md) (15 minutes)
- [Mogno Lab](MongoLab_Student.ipynb) (60 minutes)

Note that a pair exercise is included. This pair exercise makes sense _after_ this lab has been completed.



# Learning Objectives

Students will be able to
- Install datasets from JSON files using the `mongoimport` shell command
- Do simple find queries with mongo shell
- Be able to connect python to to a mongo instance using PyMongo
- Do simple find queries with PyMongo
- Iterate through cursors to process results from Mongo in Python
- Be able to run aggregation pipelines from Python on mongo collections
- Be able to insert and delete records from a collection
- Be able to drop collections from a database

# Additional Resources
- Extra files in the installation directory for installing mongo on AWS, and accessing it remotely.
- Other JSON datafiles for experimenting with in the `data/` directory
- `TwitterAPI.ipynb` has some nice examples of using different aggregations. The `twitter` folder also shows how to setup TwitterAPI, and includes some notes on Twitter streaming. Instructions on getting the API key and using `.env` files are also included here
